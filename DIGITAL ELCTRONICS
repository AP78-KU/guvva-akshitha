# what is digital electronics?     
     DIGITAL ELECTRONICS is a field of electronics involving the study of digital signals and the engineering of devices that use or produce them.It deals with tha relationship between binary inputs 
     and outputs by passing electrical signals thourgh logical gates, resistors, capacitors,amplifiers,, and other electrical components.Digital electronics is a branch of electronics that deals with 
     systems and devices that use digital signals, which are dicrete representation of data typicallyusing binary code (0s and 1s).unlike analog electronics, which deals with continuos signals, digital
     electronics processes data in finite set of values.
     DIGITAL SIGNALS 
      Digtal signals represent data using a finite number of levels,commonly binary(o and 1), according to chipEdge VlSI training company. This discrete representaion maks them less susceptiable to noise 
      and easier to stire and transimit compared to analog signals.
      LOGIC GATES
       DIGITRAL ELECTRONICS uses logic gates (AND OR NOT) to perform logical operations on binary signals. these gates are building block of digital circuits
      DIGITAL CIRCUITS 
       digital circuits of composed of logic gates and other components that process and manipulate digiatal signals.they are used to implement various functions such as arithmetic operations, data storage 
       and contol logic.
# APPLICATIONS OF DIGITAL ELECTRONICS.

       *it is also used for controlling and operating.
       *it is also used in medical equipment, home applinces, and other applications.
#LOGIC LEVELS IN DIGITAL ELECTRONICS.
        in digital electronics, logic levels represent the two binary states(0 and 1).as voltage levels in a circuit a logic high 1 is typically a higher voltage than logic low.the specific voltage range for logic high and low are defined by the technology used in circuit such as TTL or CMOS
