# What is digital electronics

*Digital electronics* is a field of electronics involving the study of digital signals and the engineering of devices that use or produce them.
It deals with the relationship betwwn the binary inputs and outputs by passing electrical signals through logical gates, resistors,capacitors,amplifiers and other elecrical components.
It is using the digital signals which are discrete representation of data, typically using binary code(0s and 1s).
unlike analog electronics which deals with the continuous signals, digital electronics processe the data in a finite set of values,
